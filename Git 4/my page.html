  <h2>About My Other Skills</h2>
  <p>I am very good at Selenium which is a testing suite for automation testing that uses Java for automating the test suites to make sure that the application works as expected by tracking bugs and fixing them up and Software Project Management which embraces Reviewing plans, requirements and specifications during the design of the project. In Software Project Management, I have learnt more about team management as I have experience as Team Lead in one of my academic projects. I got chance to learn these as I have taken two courses like Software Project Management and Sofware Quality Assurance and Test Automation.I have learned these as extra to just improve my knowledge in all directions by keeping UI Development as principal skill </p>
